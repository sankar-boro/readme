The **WHATWG Encoding Standard** is a specification that defines how text should be encoded and decoded in web environments, particularly in HTML and browser APIs. It ensures consistent handling of character encodings across different web technologies.

### **Key Aspects of the WHATWG Encoding Standard**

1. **UTF-8 as the Default Encoding**

   - Modern web standards require UTF-8 for encoding web content.
   - HTML5 mandates UTF-8 for documents unless explicitly declared otherwise.
   - Most browsers default to UTF-8, making it the dominant encoding on the web.

2. **Legacy Encoding Support**

   - While UTF-8 is preferred, browsers still need to support older character encodings like ISO-8859-1, Shift_JIS, and Windows-1252 for backward compatibility.
   - The standard defines how these legacy encodings should be mapped to Unicode.

3. **Encoding and Decoding Algorithms**

   - The standard provides detailed algorithms for encoding and decoding text.
   - It ensures consistent interpretation of byte sequences into Unicode characters.

4. **Used by Web APIs**

   - Many web technologies, like `TextDecoder`, `TextEncoder`, and `document.characterSet`, follow the WHATWG Encoding Standard.
   - Example usage in JavaScript:
     ```js
     const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
     const encoded = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]); // "Hello" in UTF-8
     console.log(decoder.decode(encoded)); // Output: "Hello"
     ```

5. **Normalization of Labeling**
   - The standard defines **labels** for encodings (e.g., `"latin1"` maps to `"windows-1252"`).
   - Ensures browsers handle encoding names consistently.

### **Why It Matters**

- Ensures interoperability of text across different browsers.
- Helps avoid encoding mismatches that can lead to text corruption.
- Supports seamless handling of different languages and character sets.
