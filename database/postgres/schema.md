Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down.

## üîπ What is a Schema in a Database?

- A **schema** is like a **namespace** or **folder** inside your database.
- It helps **organize database objects** such as tables, views, sequences, functions, etc.
- PostgreSQL (and many RDBMSs) come with a default schema called **`public`** ‚Äî so if you create a table without specifying a schema, it goes there.
- You can create multiple schemas to **separate concerns**, for example:

  - `sales` ‚Üí tables related to sales data
  - `hr` ‚Üí employee-related tables
  - `analytics` ‚Üí reporting tables

This way, two schemas can even have **tables with the same name** without conflict:

```sql
sales.orders
hr.orders
```

(both exist separately because they live in different schemas).

---

You can drop the `public` schema, but be careful ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **default schema** in every PostgreSQL database.

### Command:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA public;
```

### üîé What happens:

- Drops the `public` schema entirely.
- All tables, sequences, functions, etc. inside it will be **deleted**.
- After this, new objects created without specifying a schema will fail (since `public` no longer exists, and it‚Äôs in `search_path` by default).

---

### ‚úÖ Safe ways people usually handle it

If you want to **wipe it clean** but keep the schema around (since many extensions and tools expect `public` to exist), use:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO postgres;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO public;
```

This:

1. Drops everything inside `public`.
2. Recreates the schema fresh.
3. Restores the default grants.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è If your goal is to **restrict usage of `public`** instead of dropping it, a safer pattern is:

```sql
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM <USERNAME>;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM <USERNAME>;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME> FROM PUBLIC;
```

That way, users can‚Äôt create or use objects in `public`, but the schema still exists for system defaults.

üëâ Do you want me to include this in your **permissions & schema management cheat sheet PDF**, so you‚Äôll have both the GRANT/REVOKE and DROP/RECREATE best practices together?

## üîπ How to Create a New Schema

In PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;
```

If you want to assign ownership (so a specific user controls it):

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema AUTHORIZATION my_user;
```

---

## üîπ Using Schemas

When you create objects, you can specify the schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_schema.customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

To query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_schema.customers;
```

---

## üîπ Default Search Path

If you don‚Äôt want to type `my_schema.` every time, you can adjust the **search path**:

```sql
SET search_path TO my_schema, public;
```

This makes PostgreSQL look in `my_schema` first, then `public`.

---

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **ready-to-run PostgreSQL setup script**.
Just replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` and `<USERNAME>` with your values (and a secure password).

```sql
-- 1. Connect to your database first
\c <DATABASE_NAME>;

-- 2. Create a new user (role) with login
CREATE ROLE <USERNAME> LOGIN PASSWORD 'StrongPasswordHere';

-- 3. Create a new schema owned by this user
CREATE SCHEMA <USERNAME> AUTHORIZATION <USERNAME>;

-- 4. Revoke default access on the public schema (good practice)
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME> FROM PUBLIC;

-- 5. Grant privileges on the new schema
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA <USERNAME> TO <USERNAME>;

-- 6. Grant privileges on existing tables in the schema
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <USERNAME> TO <USERNAME>;

-- 7. Make sure future tables in this schema automatically get privileges
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <USERNAME> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO <USERNAME>;

-- 8. Set the default search_path so the user doesn‚Äôt need to prefix with schema name
ALTER ROLE <USERNAME> SET search_path = <USERNAME>;
```

---

### ‚úÖ What this script does

- Creates a new user and a schema **with the same name** (common convention).
- Revokes access to `public` schema (avoids clutter & accidental cross-access).
- Grants the user full DML permissions (`SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`) on **their schema only**.
- Ensures **new tables** created later also inherit the right permissions.
- Sets the schema as the **default search path** so queries can be run without schema prefix.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also extend this script so the user can **create their own tables** in the schema, or should they only have read/write access to tables you (the admin) create?

### Others

- If you are in the database and want to see tables interactively:

```sh
\dt sankar.*
\dt public.*
```
