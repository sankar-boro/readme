### **Advanced CSS Concepts**  
- **CSS Grid**: A two-dimensional layout system for rows and columns.  
- **Flexbox**: A one-dimensional layout method for aligning items in rows or columns.  
- **Custom Properties (CSS Variables)**: Variables for reuse of property values.  
- **Media Queries**: For responsive design, applying styles based on device characteristics.  
- **Dark Mode Support**: Using `prefers-color-scheme` media query.  
- **Container Queries**: Apply styles based on the size of the container instead of the viewport.  
- **CSS Houdini**: APIs that expose parts of the CSS engine to developers for deeper styling control.  
- **Subgrid**: Allows nested grids to inherit and align with the outer grid's tracks.  
- **Logical Properties**: Properties like `margin-inline-start`, `padding-block-end` for writing mode independence.
