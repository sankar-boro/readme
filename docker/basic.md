Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using **containers**. Containers allow developers to package an application with all its dependencies (libraries, tools, configuration files) into a single unit that runs consistently across different environments.

### üîß **Key Concepts of Docker**  
- **Image:** A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.  
- **Container:** A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system but share the OS kernel.  
- **Dockerfile:** A script containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image.  
- **Docker Hub:** A cloud-based registry where you can find and share Docker images.  
- **Docker Engine:** The runtime that runs and manages Docker containers.  
- **Volume:** A persistent storage mechanism used by Docker to store data outside of containers.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Basic Docker Commands**  
#### 1. **Working with Docker Images**  
- Pull an image from Docker Hub:  
  ```bash
  docker pull <image_name>
  ```
- List available images:  
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- Build an image from a Dockerfile:  
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image_name> .
  ```

---

#### 2. **Managing Containers**  
- Run a container:  
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name <container_name> <image_name>
  ```
  - `-d`: Run in detached mode (in the background).  
  - `-p`: Map host port to container port.  

- List running containers:  
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- Stop a container:  
  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id_or_name>
  ```
- Start a stopped container:  
  ```bash
  docker start <container_id_or_name>
  ```
- Remove a container:  
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id_or_name>
  ```

---

#### 3. **Docker Volumes (Persistent Storage)**  
- Create a volume:  
  ```bash
  docker volume create <volume_name>
  ```
- Use a volume in a container:  
  ```bash
  docker run -d -v <volume_name>:/path/in/container <image_name>
  ```

---

#### 4. **Docker Networks**  
- Create a network:  
  ```bash
  docker network create <network_name>
  ```
- Connect a container to a network:  
  ```bash
  docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
  ```

### üì¶ **Dockerfile Example**  
Here's a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use Node.js LTS version as base image
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

To build and run the container:  
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

---

### üåê **Docker Compose**  
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications. You use a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure the services.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml` for Node.js and PostgreSQL:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

Run using:  
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### ‚ö° **Why Use Docker?**  
- Consistency across environments (dev, test, prod).  
- Lightweight and fast compared to virtual machines.  
- Easy scaling and deployment of microservices.  
- Simplifies CI/CD pipelines.
